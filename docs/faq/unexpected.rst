How do I troubleshoot ossec?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    
    If you are having problems with ossec, the first thing to do is to look at 
    your logs. 
    
    * Unix/Linux: The logs will be at /var/ossec/logs/ossec.log
    * Windows: The logs are at  C:\Program Files\ossec-agent\ossec.log. 

    If by looking at them, you can't find out the error, we suggest you to send an 
    e-mail to one of our mailing lists with the following information: 

    * OSSEC version number.

        Run the following to get the version installation. 

        .. code-block:: console

            # /var/ossec/bin/ossec-analysisd -V

    * Content of /etc/ossec-init.conf
    * Content of /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf or (or C:\Program Files\ossec-agent\ossec.log if Windows)
    * Content of /var/ossec/logs/ossec.log 
    * Operating system name/version (uname -a if Unix)
    * Any other relevant information. 



How to debug ossec?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    .. warning::

        Only read this section if you tried to troubleshoot ossec already, but 
        didn't have lucky solving your problem.  Most of the users will never need 
        to enable debugging, since it can significantly hurt performance. 

    **Debug Logging** 

    You can also enable debugging mode on ossec to extract more data about 
    what is going on. To do so, you will need to modify the file 
    /var/ossec/etc/internal_options.conf (or 
    C:\\Program Files\\ossec-agent\\internal_options.conf on Windows) and change 
    the debug level from the default "0" to "1" or "2". 

    For example, if you wish to debug your windows agent, just change the option 
    windows.debug from 0 to 2. Bellow is the list of all the debug options:

    .. code-block:: console 

        # Debug options.
        # Debug 0 -> no debug
        # Debug 1 -> first level of debug
        # Debug 2 -> full debugging

        # Windows debug (used by the windows agent)
        windows.debug=0

        # Syscheck (local, server and unix agent)
        syscheck.debug=0

        # Remoted (server debug)
        remoted.debug=0

        # Analysisd (server or local)
        analysisd.debug=0

        # Log collector (server, local or unix agent)
        logcollector.debug=0

        # Unix agentd
        agent.debug=0

    If this is on an OSSEC server you can enable debug by running:

    .. code-block:: console

       # /var/ossec/bin/ossec-control enable debug

    Enable debug mode and restart the OSSEC processes to view more verbose logs.

    **Getting more log data** 

    If you are up to editing the source and recompiling, you can use the verbose() 
    function to add entries to the log. This has been helpful on at least one occasion 
    to help pinpoint where a problem was occurring. Something along these lines should 
    work (at least in 1.3):

    .. code-block:: c 

        verbose("MyName: inside the_file.c the_function() %s ..", the_string); 

    * If you tag all your extra logs with something, MyName, in this example, they 
      stand out better.
    * If you need to get information from several source files, including the file 
      name the_file.c, in this example is helpful.
    * You will almost surely want information from more than one fuction, including 
      the name, the_fuction() will show which function sent the log.
    * Finally, you can include a variable string with the printf format specifier %s 
      in the log entry and the_string is the name of the string variable to send to the log.
    
    With some calls to verbose, recompile and replace the stock binary with your edited 
    one. Restart ossec and tail the log.

.. _faq_unexpected_comm:

The communication between my agent and the server is not working. What to do? 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    There are multiple reasons for it to happen. First, you should look at 
    your agent and server logs to see what they say.  If you don't know where they 
    are, go to our Troubleshooting page for more information. 

    In addition to that, follow the step by step at the end, if you need to add/re-add 
    the authentication keys.

    **There is a firewall between the agent and the server.**

    If you have the following message on the agent log:

    .. code-block:: console 

        2007/04/19 12:42:54 ossec-agentd(4101): Waiting for server reply (not started).
        2007/04/19 12:43:10 ossec-agentd(4101): Waiting for server reply (not started).
        2007/04/19 12:43:41 ossec-agentd(4101): Waiting for server reply (not started).
        2007/04/19 12:44:27 ossec-agentd(4101): Waiting for server reply (not started).

    And nothing on the server log, you probably have a firewall between the two 
    devices. Make sure to open port 1514 UDP between them (keeping state --the 
    agent connects to the server and expects a reply back).

    .. note:: 

        The way the agent/server communication works is that the agent starts a 
        connection to the server using any random high port. So, the only port that 
        OSSEC opens is in the server side (port 1514 UDP). It works similar to DNS, 
        where the DNS client connects to UDP port 53 and expects a reply back.

    **Wrong authentication keys configured (you imported a key from a different agent).**

    If that's the case, you would be getting logs similar to the above on the agent 
    and the following on the server (see also Errors:1403):

    .. code-block:: console 

        2007/05/23 09:27:35 ossec-remoted(1403): Incorrectly formated message from 'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx'.
        2007/05/23 09:27:35 ossec-remoted(1403): Incorrectly formated message from 'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx'.''

    **The IP address you configured the agent is different from what the server is seeing.**

    Same as above (see also see Errors:1403). 

    **Step by Step -- adding the authentication keys**

    For most of the errors (except the firewall issue), removing and re-adding the authentication keys 
    fix the problem. Do the following if you are having issues:

    #. 'Stop the server and the agent.'
        
        *  Make sure they are really stopped (ps on Unix or sc query ossecsvc on Windows)

    #. Run the manage-agents tool on the server and remove the agent.
    #. Still on the server, add the agent using manage-agents. Make sure the IP is correct.
    #. Start the server. 
    #.  Run manage-agents on the agent and import the newly generated key.
    #. Start the agent.

    If after that, it still doesn't work, contact our mailing list for help.

What does "1403 - Incorrectly formated message" means? 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It means that the server (or agent) wasn't able to decrypt the message from the 
other side of the connection.  See `The communication between my agent and the server is not working. What to do?`_

The main reasons for this to happen are:

- Wrong authentication keys configured (you imported a key from a different agent).
- The IP address you configured the agent is different from what the server is seeing.

How to fix it: 

- Check if you imported the right authentication keys into the agent.
- Check if the IP address is correctly. 
- You can also try to remove the agent (using manage_agents), add it back again 
  and re-import the keys into the agent. Make sure to restart the server (first) 
  and then the agent after that.

.. 1202

What does "1210 - Queue not accessible?" mean?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Check queue/ossec/queue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have logs similar to the following in ``/var/ossec/queue/ossec/queue``::

    2008/04/29 15:40:39 ossec-syscheckd(1210): ERROR: Queue '/var/ossec/queue/ossec/queue' not accessible: 'Connection refused'.
    2008/04/29 15:40:39 ossec-rootcheck(1210): ERROR: Queue '/var/ossec/queue/ossec/queue' not accessible: 'Connection refused'.
    2008/04/29 15:40:45 ossec-logcollector(1210): ERROR: Queue '/var/ossec/queue/ossec/queue' not accessible: 'Connection refused'.
    2008/04/29 15:40:45 ossec-logcollector(1211): ERROR: Unable to access queue: '/var/ossec/queue/ossec/queue'. Giving up..
    2008/04/29 15:41:00 ossec-syscheckd(1210): ERROR: Queue '/var/ossec/queue/ossec/queue' not accessible: 'Connection refused'.
    2008/04/29 15:41:00 ossec-rootcheck(1211): ERROR: Unable to access queue: '/var/ossec/queue/ossec/queue'. Giving up.. 

It means that :ref:`ossec-analysisd` is not running for some reason.

**The main reasons for this to happen are:**

- :ref:`ossec-analysisd` didn't start properly. Look at the logs for any error from it.
- :ref:`ossec-analysisd` didn't start at all. There is a bug in the init scripts that 
  during system reboot, it may not start if the PID is already in use (we are working 
  to fix it).
- :ref:`ossec-analysisd` cannot access ``/queue/fts/fts-queue``. Look for the error message ``ossec-analysisd(1103): ERROR: Unable to open file '/queue/fts/fts-queue'.`` This can be fixed by ensuring that the ossec user owns ``/var/ossec/queue/fts/fts-queue``.

**How to fix it:** 

Stop OSSEC and start it back again:

.. code-block:: console 

    # /var/ossec/bin/ossec-control stop
    (you can also check at /var/ossec/var/run that there is not PID file in there)
    # /var/ossec/bin/ossec-control start

If there is any configuration error, fix it. 


Check queue/alerts/ar 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have logs similar to the following in ``/var/ossec/queue/alerts/ar``::

    2009/02/17 12:03:04 ossec-analysisd(1210): ERROR: Queue '/queue/alerts/ar' not accessible: 'Connection refused'.
    2009/02/17 12:03:04 ossec-analysisd(1301): ERROR: Unable to connect to active response queue.
    
It means that there is nothing listening on the other end of the socket the 
:ref:`ossec-analysisd` deamon would want to write to. This can happen in an ossec 
server installation. The deamon that should be listening on this socket is 
:ref:`ossec-remoted`.  

**How to fix it:** 

Add an OSSEC client (agent) with the :ref:`manage_agents` utility on both agent 
and server. Then restart OSSEC. :ref:`ossec-remoted` should now be listening on 
the socket.


Remote commands are not accepted from the manager. Ignoring it on the agent.conf
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This error message is caused by ``command`` or ``full_command`` log types in the agent.conf.
Originally OSSEC supported running commands from the agent.conf by default. Thie was later changed as a security 
precaution due to the commands being run as root. When a command is encountered on an agent in the agent.conf 
this error will be produced and the agent may not fully start. This error may also accompany the above error 
message:

.. code-block:: console

    ERROR: Configuration error at '/var/ossec-agent/etc/shared/agent.conf'. Exiting.

Errors when dealing with multiple agents 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you have hundreds (or even thousands) of agents, OSSEC may not work 
properly by default. There are a few changes that you will need to do:

**Increase maximum number of allowed agents**

To increase the number of agents, before you install (or update OSSEC), just do:

.. code-block:: console 

    #cd src; make setmaxagents (it will ask how many do you want.. )

    Specify maximum number of agents: 2048 (to increase to 2048)
    Maximum number of agents set to 20.

    #cd ..; ./install.sh

**Increase your system's limits**

Most systems have limits regarding the maximum number of files you can have. 
A few commands you should try are (to increase to 2048):

.. code-block:: console 

    # ulimit -n 2048
    # sysctl -w kern.maxfiles=2048 


Fixing Duplicate Errors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ossec agents and server keep a counter of each message sent and received in files in .../ossec/queue/rids.
This is a technique to prevent replay attacks. If the counters between agent and server don't match you'll see errors like this in the agents ossec.log file:

.. code-block:: console

    2007/10/24 11:19:21 ossec-agentd: Duplicate error:  global: 12, local: 3456, saved global: 78, saved local: 91011
    2007/10/24 11:19:21 ossec-agentd(<pid>): Duplicated counter for '<host name>'.
    2007/10/24 11:19:21 ossec-agentd(<pid>): Problem receiving message from www.xxx.yyy.zzz.

This normally happens when you restore the ossec files from a backup or you reinstall server or agents without performing an upgrade, this can also be caused by duplicate agent ID's.
The fix for this problem is:

1. On every agent:
 
  #. stop ossec

  #. go to: .../ossec/queue/rids (or ossec-agent/rids on Windows) and remove every file in there.

2. Go to the server:

  #. Stop ossec

  #. Remove the rids file with the same name as the agent id that is reporting errors.
 
3. Restart the server

4. Restart the agents.

To avoid this problem from ever happening again, make sure to:
    * Always use the update option (when updating). Do not remove and reinstall the ossec server, unless you plan to do the same for all agents.
    * Do not re-use the same agent key between multiple agents or the same agent key after you remove/re-install an agent. If you use the "update" options everything should just work.


Agent won't connect to the manager or the agent always shows never connected
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following log messages may appear in the ``ossec.log`` file on an agent when it is having issues connecting to a manager:

.. code-block:: console

    2011/11/13 18:05:13 ossec-agent: WARN: Process locked. Waiting for permission...
    2011/11/13 18:05:24 ossec-agent(4101): WARN: Waiting for server reply (not started). Tried: '10.10.134.241'.
    2011/11/13 18:05:26 ossec-agent: INFO: Trying to connect to server (10.10.134.241:1514).
    2011/11/13 18:05:26 ossec-agent: INFO: Using IPv4 for: 10.10.134.241 .
    2011/11/13 18:05:47 ossec-agent(4101): WARN: Waiting for server reply (not started). Tried: '10.10.134.241'.

If the agent's packets are making it to the manager, the manager will also include error messages in its ``ossec.log`` related to that agent. Some possible issues:

* The agent may not be using the correct IP address. Some systems with multiple IP addresses may not choose the correct one to communicate with the OSSEC manager. Using ``any`` or a CIDR address (192.168.1.0/24) for the agent may be one solution, and adjusting the system's route settings is another.

* Every agent must be using a unique key. If 2 agents look like they're coming from the same IP (possibly from a NAT gateway), then ``any`` or the CIDR address should be used to identify them on the manager.

* There may be a firewall blocking the OSSEC traffic, udp 1514 should be allowed to and from the manager.

* UAC may be blocking the OSSEC service from communicating with the manager on Windows 7.

I am seeing high CPU utilization on a Windows agent
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some OSSEC HIDS users who have deployed the Windows agent have experienced situations where the windows OSSEC agent causes high CPU utilization. In some cases, this may be due to syscheck having to do integrity checking on a large number of files and the frequency with which this is done. The high CPU utilization could also take place when the OSSEC agent has to analyze Windows Event logs with very large numbers of generated events.

A clue to what may be happening are alerts like these:

.. code-block:: console

  OSSEC HIDS Notification.
  2006 Oct 24 03:18:07

  Received From: (ACME-5) 10.23.54.40->WinEvtLog
  Rule: 11 fired (level 8) -> "Excessive number of events (above normal)."
  Portion of the log(s):

  The average number of logs between 3:00 and 4:00 is 268689. We reached 270690.



  --END OF NOTIFICATION

The above alert indicates the condition where a large number of events are being generated in the Windows event logs. In Windows, setting the Windows audit policy to `Audit Object Access <http://technet2.microsoft.com/WindowsServer/en/library/50fdb7bc-7dae-4dcd-8591-382aeff2ea791033.mspx?mfr=true>`_ or `Audit Process Tracking <http://technet2.microsoft.com/WindowsServer/en/library/50fdb7bc-7dae-4dcd-8591-382aeff2ea791033.mspx?mfr=true>`_ can cause the generation of many event log entries. This gives the OSSEC agent much more work to do in log analysis, and thus causes the consumption of much more CPU cycles. To reduce the CPU utilization in this case, the solution is to disable auditing of object access and/or process tracking. Typically, these audit settings aren't required except for debugging purposes, or situations in which you absolutely have to track everything.
