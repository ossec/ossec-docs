.. _usb_storage:

How do you monitor for usb storage?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    The first step is to configure the agents to check a registry entry with the ``reg`` command:

    .. code-block:: xml

      <agent_config os="Windows">
        <localfile>
          <log_format>full_command</log_format>
          <command>reg QUERY HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USBSTOR</command>
          <alias>usb-check</alias>
        </localfile>
      </agent_config>

    Next create a local rule for that command:

    .. code-block:: xml

      <rule id="140125" level="7">
        <if_sid>530</if_sid>
        <match>ossec: output: 'usb-check':</match>
        <check_diff />
        <description>New USB device connected</description>
      </rule>

    When a USB drive is inserted into a Windows machine, an alert will not be triggered. 
    The alert will contain a diff of the registry entry before the USB device was inserted and after.

.. _grouped_email_alerts:

Why do I see alerts for agent2 in an email about agent1?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    When an email is being prepared alerts will be grouped together. The only real criteria for grouping alerts together is the timeframe.
    To prevent alerts from being grouped together you can set ``maild.groupping`` to 0 in ``/var/ossec/etc/internal_options.conf``.
    If this is set, alerts will be sent out individually. By default OSSEC will only send 12 emails per hour.
    To increase this limit, modify or add the <email_maxperhour> setting in the ``<global>`` section of the ``ossec.conf``.
    (see: `email_maxperhour <../syntax/head_ossec_config.global.html#element-email_maxperhour>`_ .)



    .. code-block:: xml

        <global>
          <email_maxperhour>100</email_maxperhour>

.. _herp_derp_grouping:

Alerts for different sensors are appearing in the same email, how do I stop this from happening?

.. _ignore_1002:

How do I ignore rule 1002?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Rule 1002 is a catch-all rule. It looks for keywords that are generally considered "bad."
    It also means there is not currently a rule that deals with the log message.
    It is configured to always send an email when it's triggered, and many users have found it annoying.
    The best thing to do when you encounter something that triggers rule 1002 is write a rule. 
    Contributing the logs and/or rules back to the project is also encouraged.
    Unless the application creating the log is an internal application, someone else may find the rule useful.


.. _too_many_emails:

I set the <email_alert_level> to 10, why do I keep seeing rules with lower levels?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Some rules have an option set to force OSSEC into sending an alert email. This option is ``<options>alert_by_email</options>``. 
   One of these rules is 1002. To ignore these rules you will have to create a rule to specifically ignore it,
   or overwrite the rule without the ``alert_by_email`` option.
