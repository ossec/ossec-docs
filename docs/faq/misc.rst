What are the github issues intended to be used for?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Due to the technical nature of OSSEC, it can be difficult, 
to troubleshoot an issue. Because of the time and effort 
involved, the `mailing list  <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ossec-list>`_
is the preferred method of seeking help.
Github issues are great for tracking discovered bugs, but 
are more difficult for communicating when troubleshooting.
