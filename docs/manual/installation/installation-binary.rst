Compiling OSSEC for a Binary Installation 
=========================================

OSSEC is typically compiled on each system it is installed on, but this may not always be easy. 
To help in these cases there are a few methods of binary installation available. OSSEC can be 
compiled on one system, and copied to the destination systems. There ar RPM and deb packages 
available.



.. note:: 

    OSSEC has very limited cross compiling facilities. Windows binaries can be built on Linux systems, 
    but binaries for other systems should be built on a system of the same OS and CPU platform.

Compiling OSSEC for install on a second server 
----------------------------------------------

First download the OSSEC package corresponding to the version you want to 
install and unpack it (on the system with a compiler).

.. code-block:: console 

    # wget https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/archive/2.9.1.tar.gz
    # tar -zxvf 2.9.1.tar.gz 

    
Enter in the source directory of the downloaded package, and configure OSSEC to build the ``agent`` version.
The ``make`` commands should compile the correct binaries.

For 2.9 and later:

.. code-block:: console 

    # cd ossec-*/src
    # make TARGET=agent

For 2.8 and before:

.. code-block:: console

    # cd ossec-*/src
    # make setagent
    # make all
    # make build

Modify ossec-hids-*/etc/preloaded-vars.conf to set BINARY_INSTALL to yes. 

.. code-block:: console 

    # echo "USER_BINARYINSTALL=\"y\"" >> ossec-hids*/etc/preloaded-vars.conf

Finally create an OSSEC package.

.. code-block:: console 

    # tar -cvf ossec-binary.tar ossec-hids*

.. _manual-install-binary-install: 

Installation of the binary OSSEC package 
----------------------------------------

On the target system (that does not have a C compiler) download your ossec-binary.tar 
created in the steps above. 

Complete the installation by unarchiving the binary package and running ./install.sh. 

.. code-block:: console 

    # tar xfv ossec-binary.tar
    # cd ossec-* 
    # ./install.sh 

After following the installation prompts the install will be complete.
