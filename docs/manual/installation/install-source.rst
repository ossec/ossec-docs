Manager/Agent Installation
==========================


Installation of OSSEC HIDS is very simple, the ``install.sh`` shell script automating most of it.
There are a few questions to be answered before the installation will occur, one of the most 
important being which type of installation is desired.
It is important to choose the correct installation type: server, agent, local, or hybrid.
More information on thse can be found on the `OSSEC Architecture page <../ossec-architecture.html>`_.

.. note::

    In the following installation the commands follow the ``#``. 
    Everything else is either comments out output. 

#. Download the latest version and verify its checksum.

    .. note:: 

        On some systems, the command md5, sha1, or wget may not exist. Try md5sum, sha1sum 
        or lynx respectively instead.

    .. code-block:: console

        # wget http://www.ossec.net/files/ossec-hids-2.7.1.tar.gz
        # wget http://www.ossec.net/files/ossec-hids-2.7.1-checksum.txt
        # cat ossec-hids-2.7.1_checksum.txt
        MD5 (ossec-hids-2.7.1.tar.gz) = f4140ecf25724b8e6bdcaceaf735138a
        SHA1 (ossec-hids-2.7.1.tar.gz) = 258b9a24936e6b61e0478b638e8a3bfd3882d91e
        MD5 (ossec-agent-win32-2.7.1.exe) = 7d2392459aeab7490f28a10bba07d8b5
        SHA1 (ossec-agent-win32-2.7.1.exe) = fdb5225ac0ef631d10e5110c1c1a8aa473e62ab4
        # md5sum ossec-hids-2.7.1.tar.gz 
        MD5 (ossec-hids-2.7.1.tar.gz) = f4140ecf25724b8e6bdcaceaf735138a
        # sha1sum ossec-hids-2.7.1.tar.gz
        SHA1 (ossec-hids-2.7.1.tar.gz) = 258b9a24936e6b61e0478b638e8a3bfd3882d91e


#. Extract the compressed package and run the ``install.sh`` script. It will guide you 
   through the installation.

    .. code-block:: console 

        # tar -zxvf ossec-hids-*.tar.gz (or gunzip -d; tar -xvf)
        # cd ossec-hids-* 
        # ./install.sh

#. The OSSEC manager listens on UDP port 1514. Any firewall sbetween the agents and 
   the manager will need to allow this traffic.

#. The server, agent, and hybrid installations will require additional configuration. 
   More information can be found on the `Managing the agents page <../agent/agent-management.html>`_.

#. Start OSSEC HIDS by running the following command:

    .. code-block:: console 

        # /var/ossec/bin/ossec-control start
