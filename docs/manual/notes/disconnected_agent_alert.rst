Disconnected Agent Alert
------------------------

In certain circumstances, OSSEC may not alert on disconnected agents. By
putting this line in root's crontab(1), an alert will be sent for any
disconnected agents, but only if there is at least one:

.. code-block:: console

  15,30,45,59 * * * * /var/ossec/bin/list_agents -n | grep -q "No agent available" || /var/ossec/bin/list_agents -n | mail -s "Disconnected OSSEC Agents" user@example.com


Replace the path to OSSEC and the e-mail address with values suitable to
your installation.

(1) This needs to be done as root, however since OSSEC will immediately
chroot and drop privileges the software executes it safely. It will run
every fifteen minutes. Adjust to suit your own tolerance. This is one
line; watch for wrapping.
