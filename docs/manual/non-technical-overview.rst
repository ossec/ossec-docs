Getting started with OSSEC
==========================

OSSEC is a platform to monitor and control your systems. It mixes together 
all the aspects of HIDS (host-based intrusion detection), log monitoring, and 
SIM/SIEM together in a simple, powerful, and open source solution.


Key Benefits
------------

Compliance Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OSSEC helps customers meet specific compliance requirements such as PCI and HIPAA.
It lets customers detect and alert on unauthorized file system modifications 
and malicious behavior embedded in the log files of commercial products as well as 
custom applications. For PCI, it covers the sections of file integrity monitoring 
(PCI 11.5, 10.5), log inspection and monitoring (section 10), and policy 
enforcement/checking.

Multi platform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OSSEC lets customers implement a comprehensive host based intrusion detection 
system with fine grained application/server specific policies across multiple 
platforms such as Linux, Solaris, Windows, and Mac OS X.

Real-time and Configurable Alerts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OSSEC lets customers configure incidents they want to be alerted on which lets 
them focus on raising the priority of critical incidents over the regular noise 
on any system. Integration with smtp, sms and syslog allows customers to be on 
top of alerts by sending these on to e-mail and handheld devices such as cell 
phones and pagers. Active response options to block an attack immediately is 
also available.

Integration with current infrastructure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OSSEC will integrate with current investments from customers such as SIM/SEM 
(Security Incident Management/Security Events Management) products for centralized 
reporting and correlation of events.

Centralized management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OSSEC provides a simplified centralized management server to manage policies 
across multiple operating systems. Additionally, it also lets customers define 
server specific overrides for finer grained policies.

Agent and agentless monitoring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OSSEC offers the flexibility of agent based and agentless monitoring of systems 
and networking components such as routers and firewalls. It lets customers who 
have restrictions on software being installed on systems (such as FDA approved 
systems or appliances) meet security and compliance needs.

Key Features
------------

File Integrity checking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is one thing in common to any attack to your networks and computers: they 
change your systems in some way. The goal of file integrity checking (or FIM - 
file integrity monitoring) is to detect these changes and alert you when they 
happen. It can be an attack, or a misuse by an employee or even a typo by an 
admin, any file, directory or registry change will be alerted to you.

Covers PCI DSS sections 11.5 and 10.5.5.

Log Monitoring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your operating system wants to speak to you, but do you know how to listen? Every 
operating system, application, and device on your network generate logs (events) 
to let you know what is happening. OSSEC collects, analyzes and correlates these 
logs to let you know if something wrong is going on (attack, misuse, errors, etc). 
Do you want to know when an application is installed on your client box? Or when 
someone changes a rule in your firewall? By monitoring your logs, OSSEC will let 
you know of that.

Covers PCI DSS section 10 in a whole.

Rootkit detection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Criminals (also known as hackers) want to hide their actions, but using rootkit 
detection you can be notified when they (or trojans, viruses, etc) change your 
system in this way.

Active response
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Take immediate and automatic responses when something happens. Why wait for hours 
when you can alert your admin and block an attack right way?
