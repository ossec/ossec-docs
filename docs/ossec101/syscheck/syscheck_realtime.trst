.. _ossec_101_syscheck_realtime:


Syscheck's realtime option can be quite useful for very important directories.
By default the realtime option is not used, and it is only available on Linux and Windows.

To enable this option, add ``realtime="yes"`` to an appropriate ``<directories`` entry.
This :

.. code-block:: console

  <directories check_all="yes">/bin</directories>


becomes this:

.. code-block:: console

  <directories check_all="yes" realtime="yes">/bin</directories>
