.. object:: directories

    Use this option to add or remove directories to be monitored (they must be comma separated). All files and subdirectories will also be monitored.
    Drive letters without directories are not valid. At a minimum the '.' should be included (``D:\.``). This should be set on the system you wish to 
    monitor (or in the agent.conf if appropriate).

    **Default:** /etc,/usr/bin,/usr/sbin,/bin,/sbin 

    **Attributes:**

    - **realtime**: Value=yes 

        - This will enable realtime/continuous monitoring on Linux (using the inotify system calls) and Windows systems.

    - **report_changes**: Value=yes 

        - Report diffs of file changes.  This is limited to text files at this time.

        .. note::

           This option is only available on Unix-like systems.

    - **check_all**: Value=yes 

        - All the following check_* options are used together.  
        
    - **check_sum**: Value=yes

        - Check the md5 and sha1 hashes of the  of the files will be checked.  

          This is the same as using both check_sha1sum="yes" and check_md5sum="yes"
          
    - **check_sha1sum**: Value=yes

        - When used only the sha1 hash of the files will be checked.  

    - **check_md5sum**: Value=yes

        - The md5 hash of the files will be checked.  

    - **check_size**: Value=yes

        - The size of the files will be checked.  

    - **check_owner**: Value=yes

        - Check the owner of the files selected.

        - Check the group owner of the files/directories selected.

    - **check_perm**: Value=yes
       
        - Check the UNIX permission of the files/directories selected.
          On windows this will only check the POSIX permissions. 

    - **restrict**: Value=string

        - A string that will limit checks to files containing that string in the file name.

        **Allowed:** Any directory or file name (but not a path)

.. object:: ignore 

    List of files or directories to be ignored (one entry per element). The files and directories are still checked, but the results are ignored.

    **Default:** /etc/mtab
    
    **Attributes:**

    - **type**: Value=sregex 

        - This is a simple regex pattern to filter out files so alerts are not generated.  

    **Allowed:** Any directory or file name 

.. object:: frequency

    Frequency that the syscheck is going to be executed (in seconds).

    The default is 6 hours or 21600 seconds

    **Allowed:** Time in seconds 

.. object:: scan_time 

    Time to run the scans (can be in the formats of 21pm, 8:30, 12am, etc) 

    **Allowed:** Time to run scan

.. object:: scan_day 

    Day of the week to run the scans (can be in the format of sunday, saturday, monday, etc)

    **Allowed:** Day of the week

.. _auto_ignore:
.. object:: auto_ignore 

    Specifies if syscheck will ignore files that change too often (after the third change) 

    **Default:** yes

    **Allowed:** yes/no

.. _alert_new_files:
.. object:: alert_new_files 

    Specifies if syscheck should alert on new files created. 

    **Default:** no 

    **Allowed:** yes/no 

    **Valid:** server, local

    .. note::

    **Default:** yes 

    **Allowed:** yes/no 

.. object:: windows_registry

    Use this option to add Windows registry entries to be monitored (Windows-only). 

    **Default:** HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software 

    **Allowed:** Any registry entry (one per element)

    .. note::

       New entries will not trigger alerts, only changes to existing entries.
    
.. object:: registry_ignore 

    List of registry entries to be ignored.

    **Default:** ..Cryptography\RNG

    **Allowed:** Any registry entry (one per element) 


.. object:: refilter_cmd

    Command to run to prevent prelinking from creating false positives.

    **Example:**

    .. code-block:: xml

       <prefilter_cmd>/usr/sbin/prelink -y</prefilter_cmd>

    .. note::

       This option can potentially impact performance negatively. The configured command will be run for each and every file checked.
