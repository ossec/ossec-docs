=============================
Debian Packages Now Available
=============================

Our friends at `AlienVault <http://www.alienvault.com/>`_ have created
and now host Debian packages of OSSEC for Ubuntu Wheezy, Jessie and Sid.
See the `Downloads <https://ossec.github.io/downloads.html>`_ page for the links to the packages
and AlienVault's respositories. Thanks to OSSEC Project team member
Santiago Gonzalez for taking the time to create these packages and
AlientVault for hosting them

And just a reminder, we have RPMs for all the major RedHat derived
distros courtesy of our friends at Atomicorp and long time team member
Scott Shinn.
