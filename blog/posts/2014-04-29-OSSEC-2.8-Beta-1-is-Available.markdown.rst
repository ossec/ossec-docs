=============================

=============================

The OSSEC developers have been hard at work on version 2.8 and we have
made Beta-1 packages available for testing. See the
`Downloads <https://ossec.github.io/downloads.html>`_ page. Helps us with the testing and fine
tuning of this preliminary release.
